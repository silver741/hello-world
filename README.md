generic beginner stuff.

Hello internet, I'm just a kid trying to get through middle school, and i think that designing games and coding in general is great. I don't expect it to be a job, but i do think tha ti could do it in my free time. I'm pretty bad, but atleast I try my hardest. I lke anime, science, space, and coding.
